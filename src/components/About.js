      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Nicholas Kent Unamo, a fifth-semester Software Engineering student at BINUS University Bandung. I am passionate about exploring and applying software development techniques in real-world contexts, and I enjoy gaining hands-on experience with various tools and technologies. Throughout my studies, I have developed practical skills in Software Engineering, Computer Networks, Algorithms & Programming, and Artificial Intelligence, which, alongside a strong theoretical foundation, enhance my growth in the technology sector. I aim to connect with others in the field and contribute to communities, especially those with limited access to technology, to foster growth and future advancements.</p>
